# building-geometry-visual-code-logic
Interactive visual tool that turns building-geometry definitions from US/UK/RU codes into draggable diagrams (grade/reference ground, storeys, height) to reduce misinterpretation. This project is a small desktop prototype showing how written building-code geometry definitions can be transformed into visual, guided logic. Instead of reading dense text, the user manipulates a simple building box and a ground profile made of draggable perimeter points. The app then computes a “reference ground / grade plane” proxy and visualizes storey classification and building height in a clear section view. The prototype includes three modes (US / UK / RU) with intentionally simplified, visual proxies for how each system may define the ground reference and height logic. The goal is not to replace an authority having jurisdiction, but to demonstrate a UX pattern: code requirements become interactive geometry + immediate feedback, helping architects/engineers understand what drives a pass/fail condition.
